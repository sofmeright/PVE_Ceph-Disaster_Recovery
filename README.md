# Ceph-Disaster_Recovery
This will be a work in progress repo. Please do not simply copy paste this or run this script till I have vetted it. Please watch the repo if you are wanting that. I don't want anyone's situation to get worse. But I am building a more dynamic recovery script than I could find online because we deserve it! And also creating a space for us to collab!
